# Memory Game Project

## Introduction
The Memory Game was built to test your memory skills. The purpose is to match 8 sets of cards in pairs of two in a deck. The game is won once all the cards in the deck have been matched.

## Project Purpose
This project was built as a Udacity course project. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions
To play, download the repo and open index.html, or via this link: https://amirabuhasan.github.io/memorygame.

## How to play
The "deck" consists of 8 pairs of cards - 16 in total. Clicking on a card flips it over to display it's symbol - the aim is to try to match all the cards in the deck to their respective pairs:

* If a pair matches, both cards will stay flipped.
* If they don't both cards will return to their initial state.

The game ends when all cards have been correctly matched.
