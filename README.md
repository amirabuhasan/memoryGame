# Memory Game Project

## Project Purpose

This project was built as a Udacity course project. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions
To play, download the repo and open index.html, or via this link: https://amirabuhasan.github.io/memorygame.

## How to play
The "deck" consists of 8 pairs of cards - 16 in total. Clicking on a card flips it over to display it's symbol - the aim is to try to match all the cards in the deck to their respective pairs:

* If a pair matches, both cards will stay flipped.
* If they don't both cards will return to their initial state.

The game ends when all cards have been correctly matched.

## Features
* Time tracker.
* Move tracker.
* Star Rating depending on the number of moves the user takes to complete the game.
